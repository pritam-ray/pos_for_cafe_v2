  # Fix RLS policies for inventory_transactions table

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive policies that only allow authenticated users
    - Add new policies that allow public access for inventory transactions
    - Enable INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations for public role

  This fixes the RLS violation error when creating inventory transactions.
