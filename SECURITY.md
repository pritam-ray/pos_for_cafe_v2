# Security Guidelines for C Square Restaurant System

## üîê Environment Variables Security

### Important: Never commit sensitive data to GitHub

The following files are already configured to protect your sensitive information:

- `.env` is in `.gitignore` - your actual credentials will never be pushed
- `.env.example` provides a template without real values
- Use strong, unique passwords for each role

### Setup Instructions
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in your actual values
3. Keep `.env` in your `.gitignore` file
4. Use platform environment variables in production

## üõ°Ô∏è Password Security

### Recommended Password Structure:
- **Owner Password**: 16+ characters, mix of letters, numbers, symbols
- **Employee Password**: 12+ characters, easy to remember for staff
- **Viewer Password**: 8+ characters, for demo/training purposes

### Password Rotation Schedule:
- **Owner Password**: Every 3 months
